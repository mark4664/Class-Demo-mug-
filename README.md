# Class-Demo-mug
Demo of building a class to model real world objects, in this case the common tea mug

While trying to explain to a friend what a class did and why you might want to use one I used the example of the tea 
(or coffee) mug. Of the built in __xxx__ functions only the __init__ has been included to keep the code as simple as possible.
